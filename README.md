## 📜 Lore Snapshot

The world teeters on the edge of twilight, its magic held in balance by the Moonroot Tree. Long ago, a shadowy blight crept through the land, twisting creatures into nightmares and corrupting the forests. Legends say that only an ancient guardian can restore the Moonroot’s power—and that guardian is **you**.

As you journey from sunlit glades to moonlit caverns, you’ll:
- Unearth forgotten shrines.
- Learn relic-based skills—like **Starburst** or **Moonstep**.
- Reconnect with ancestral spirits.
- Face the dark source behind the spreading blight.

Your blade, courage, and heart will shape the very fate of this enchanted realm.
